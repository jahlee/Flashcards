Hello!
This is a personal project of mine called Flashcard Maker, which, as it's name suggests, creates flashcards.

I wanted to create a project that utilized multiple different concepts I've learned like file manipulation and regular expressions, as well as create something useful to me. This is what I came up with.

This program will create a folder that will contain your projects in text files. You can add words and definitions straight in the text file, but keep in mind that my regular expressions will look for words and definitions in the following format:

word:definition

Also, at the moment, definitions can only hold up to 100 characters when printing it out in table format because I haven't created a dynamic table based off of the longest word and definition combo. So stay tuned for that.

I started this project with basic functions, and added more and more things along the way so hopefully little bugs I find will be fixed and new features will be added!

If you have any suggestions or fixes, feel free to do a pull request or simply message me somewhere and I'll look into it.

Otherwise, enjoy!
